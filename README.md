# DataCleaning_PrimaryEducation

Based on a sample dataset on access to primary education in 87 countriesâ€¦

We used common cleaning techniques in Python

We then exported our clean table to MySQL and prepared a set of queries to make our data speak

We used Matplotlib to plot country-level and region-level graphs 

We summarized the process in JIRA and GitHub
